           For the first time i saw her in school. Our exams were going on and her seat number was just beside mine, first day she came and sat beside me, i was just shocked looking at her, it was like my eyes got stuck on her. From that time i feel like she is mine already, for 2-3 days i continued starring at her but then when there was our english paper she asked me for the format of letter by writting it down on question paper, i told her the format and she thanked me i also wrote on paper telling her to meet me in break because i wanted to tell her something but in break she went on playground to play and when the school got over, she was waiting for me in-front of clark office on chair, i went there and she asked that what i wanted to tell her. I was too nervous and afraid though, i told her to understand and she replied that she got it. Then i asked for the answer but she told that she want some time to think but then after two weeks she told "yes"😱🥰i was too shocked that i didn't spoke a word and then for approx a year we were in relationship. I am in love with her since the day i saw her. And i know that we both are gonna get married to each other in future.🖤💍
